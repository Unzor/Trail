# Basics of Trail
First of all, before we get coding, we have to understand the concept of Trail.
Trail is a language where you code like a trail, but the catch is: to go back, you go down.
For example, here is the number one in Trail:
```
> > ˇ
< < <
ˇ > 
```
## What is the `ˇ` character? 
It is basically a down arrow, which is ignored by the Trail interpreter but is one of the more useful characters.
## Why is this useful? 
In Trail, you cannot place the two characters `>` and `<` next to each other, as they collide with each other. So if you want to go left, you go down.
## Okay, but what are all these characters?
All characters represent a number. For example, the character `>` represents 1 and `<` represents 0. Starting to catch on? Good. Trail is basically a way, way more useless way of coding in binary. But there are more characters than less than, greater than, and an up arrow.

Introducing the most useful character: the closing parentheses!

## What is this for, and why is this useful?
The closing parentheses is a character that represents a space, which allows you to write words, letters, and sentences.
For example, if you want to write a double-digit number like 69 (nice), the parentheses will be useful:
```
> > ˇ
< > > ˇ
< )
> > > ˇ
< < >
```
Binary representation of 69:
```
110110 111001
```

# The Examples
Okay, let's start actually writing code.
### Hello, World
```
> ˇ 
 < < > ˇ 
 < < < ) > > ˇ 
 < < > ˇ 
 < > ) > > ˇ 
 < > > ˇ 
 < < ) > > ˇ 
 < > > ˇ 
 < < ) > > ˇ 
 < > > > > ) > ˇ 
 < > > ˇ 
 < < ) > ˇ 
 < < < < < ) > ˇ 
 < > ˇ 
 < > > > ) > > ˇ 
 < > > > > ) > > > ˇ 
 < < > ˇ 
 < ) > > ˇ 
 < > > ˇ 
 < < ) > > ˇ 
 < < > ˇ 
 < < ) > ˇ 
 < < < < >
```
### 69 (nice)
```
> > ˇ
< > > ˇ
< )
> > > ˇ
< < >
```
### amogus (just 69 without parentheses) (nice again)
```
> > ˇ
< > > ˇ
< > > > ˇ
< < >
```
### Number One
```
> > ˇ
< < <
ˇ > 
```
